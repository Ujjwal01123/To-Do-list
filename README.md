# To-Do-list
In this repository, I shared code of simple but responsive and immersive web application of to do app.

This app allows users to easily:

- Add tasks to their to-do list ✅
- Mark tasks as completed ✔️
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed 🗑️
- The list automatically updates as you interact with it, offering a simple and smooth user experience.

🔧Technologies Used:

- HTML for structuring the content
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for interactive functionality

  Thanks.
